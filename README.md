# ABOUT the Epic Collections ðŸŒŸ

Epic collections is a clone of Aeropostale. Aeropostale is a clothing retailer that primarily targets young men and women between the ages of 14 and 40. Aeropostale is known for its casual and comfortable clothing styles, with a focus on denim, graphic tees, hoodies, and other trendy apparel. The brand also sells accessories such as hats, sunglasses, and jewelry.

In this project I have tried to manipulate dom elements, styling using css and tried to make a dynamic and responsive website.

# End Notes  ðŸ“‘
In this project we have tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given me experiences and I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave me a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

# Limitations 

All pages are not responsive yet, pages are not properly visible on small screen devices as I had only 6 days to complete the project.
